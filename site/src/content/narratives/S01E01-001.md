# Dolores's Morning Awakening

The scene opens in Abernathy Ranch. Dolores's family homestead.

Dolores Abernathy, Oldest host in the park, is present.

Dolores wakes up in her bed at the Abernathy ranch, experiencing what appears to be a normal morning routine. However, subtle hints suggest she's beginning to question her reality, as she notices small inconsistencies in her environment and memories.

Someone says, "Good morning, Daddy."

Someone says, "I'm going to paint today. The world is beautiful."

Dolores wakes up and gets dressed

She looks out the window at the sunrise

She notices a fly on the window

She has a brief moment of confusion about her routine
